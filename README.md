# Movie Watcher Project

This is a simple movie watcher project carried out using javascript, HTML, and CSS. This basically counts the number of people waiting outside the movie theatre by incrementing the count and when 'Save' button is pressed, the value is added to the counter value which holds all the previous count values entered before.
